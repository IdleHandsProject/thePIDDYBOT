Do not populate F1 or D6

**I somehow lost the original EagleCAD files for the PIDDYBOT. I still have the .BRD file, but no schem. I have plans to update the design with the SAMD21 instead of the Atmel, and it will be done in KiCad not Eagle. Stay Tuned**

There is an instructables on building the PIDDYBOT which contains the parts needed:
